                                  SPLICE ~
       is a Vim plugin for resolving conflicts during three-way merges.

     It's designed to be used as a merge tool for version control systems
                       like Mercurial, Git and Bazaar.

==============================================================================
1. Version Control Integration                                     *SpliceVCS*

Splice is meant to be called by your version control system when it needs you
to resolve merge conflicts.  You will need to configure your VCS to do this
before you can use Splice.

*Note: If you'd like to use a Vim GUI instead of console vim, replace
       "vim" in the following commands with your choice of "mvim" or "gvim".

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.1 Mercurial                                                   *SpliceVCS_hg*

Add the following lines to "~/.hgrc": >

    [merge-tools]
    splice.executable = vim
    splice.args = -f $base $local $other $output -c 'SpliceInit'
    splice.premerge = keep
    splice.priority = 1

Mercurial will now open Vim with Splice whenever a file has merge conflicts
which need to be resolved.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.2 Git                                                        *SpliceVCS_git*

Add the following lines to "~/.gitconfig": >

    [merge]
    tool = splice

    [mergetool "splice"]
    cmd = "vim -f $BASE $LOCAL $REMOTE $MERGED -c 'SpliceInit'"
    trustExitCode = true

If a "git merge" or "git pull" fails with merge conflicts you can now run
"git mergetool".  Git will loop over all the files with conflicts and allow
you to resolve them with Vim and Splice.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.3 Bazaar                                                     *SpliceVCS_bzr*

For Bazaar 2.4 or greater, add the following line to bazaar.conf:
>
    bzr.mergetool.splice = vim {base} {this} {other} {result} -c 'SpliceInit'
<
Optionally, change the default merge tool by setting:
>
    bzr.default_mergetool = splice
<
For earlier versions of Bazaar, set the following entry in bazaar.conf:
>
    external_merge = vim %b %t %o %r -c 'SpliceInit'
<
You can now use Vim with Splice from "bzr qconflicts".

==============================================================================
2. Basic Usage                                                   *SpliceUsage*

Splice takes a lot of inspiration for its user interface from Adobe Lightroom,
a photo editing program.

When resolving merge conflicts your goal is:

  - Examine the three files describing the changes being merged.
  - Combine these changes into a fourth file (the "result").
  - Save the result to disk.
  - Exit Vim with a non-error status code to tell the VCS the merge succeeded.

Splice has several "modes" to help you work with the various files.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1 Files                                                  *SpliceUsage_files*

When resolving a merge there are four files you will work with:

Original                                       *SpliceUsage_files_original*
    The original file, as it appears in the parent revision of the two
    revisions being merged.

One                                                 *SpliceUsage_files_one*
    The file as it appears in the first revision being merged.

    This is usually the "current" revision, or the one you are at when you
    run "hg merge REV").

Two                                                 *SpliceUsage_files_two*
    The file as it appears in the second revision being merged.

    This is usually the "target" revision, or the one you specify in the
    "hg merge REV" command).

Result                                           *SpliceUsage_files_result*
    The result of merging the two revisions of the file.

    This is the file that your version control system expects to contain the
    final result once you're done.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2 Modes                                                  *SpliceUsage_modes*

Splice has four "modes" or "views" for working with the files.

Grid                                               *SpliceUsage_modes_grid*
    Shows all four files at once to give you an overview of the merge.

    See |SpliceModes-grid| for more information.

Loupe                                             *SpliceUsage_modes_loupe*
    Shows a single file at a time for close examination of a single file.

    See |SpliceModes-loupe| for more information.

Compare                                         *SpliceUsage_modes_compare*
    Shows two files at a time for examining the movement of changes between
    pairs of files.

    See |SpliceModes-compare| for more information.

Path                                               *SpliceUsage_modes_path*
    Shows three files at a time:

      - The original
      - Either one or two
      - The result

    Used for examining how a change moves through one "path" or "branch"
    of the merge.

    See |SpliceModes-path| for more information.


==============================================================================
3. Key Bindings                                                   *SpliceKeys*

All of Splice's key mappings are prefixed with a single key to group them
together and avoid shadowing other mappings.  By default this key is '-'
(minus/hyphen).

See the |SpliceConfig_prefix| setting if you'd like to change this prefix to
something else.

All keybindings are used across (almost) all modes.

The behavior of some of them changes depending on the current mode, but the
effects should be fairly intuitive.

                        Cycle through various diff combinations.

                        Save the result file and exit Vim.

                        Indicates to the VCS that the merge was
                        successful and it should use the current
                        contents of the result file as the result.

10. Credits                                                    *SpliceCredits*

Splice was originally written by Steve Losh after he got fed up with the lack
of a powerful, intuitive, beautiful three-way merge program on OS X.

A lot of the inspiration for the layout of the code came from vim-orgmode.

The UI is a combination of ideas from Conflict2Diff.vim, Fugitive.vim, and
Adobe Lightroom.
